# GenerAIted: The Ultimate AI-Era Party Game

## Game Concept

GenerAIted is the hilarious party game where artificial intelligence meets human creativity! It's as if "Apples to Apples" had a wild night out with "What Do You Meme?" and woke up in a world ruled by ChatGPT and Midjourney.

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck of prompt cards and place it face-down in the center of the play area.
2. Shuffle the deck of image cards and deal 7 cards to each player. This forms their starting hand.
3. Choose the first "Overly Optimistic Human User" by having all players describe their most recent AI-related mishap. The player with the funniest or most relatable story goes first.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns being the "Overly Optimistic Human User" while others are "Cutting Edge AI Image Models".
2. The current Human User draws a prompt card and describes the type of image they want generated.
3. The AI Image Model players listen carefully and try to interpret what the Human User really wants.
4. Each AI Image Model player then select an image from hand and places it facedown in front of the Human User.
5. The Human User selects their favorite generated image.
6. Points are awarded to the AI Image Model player whose image was chosen.
7. The role of Human User rotates to the next player for the following round.

## Why It's Awesome

- Unleash your inner AI and provide absurd and hilarious interpretations of the Human User's image descriptions!
- Experience the joy of miscommunication as you try to decipher what the Human User really wants.
- Flex your creative muscles by coming up with the most outrageous interpretations possible.
- Perfect for tech enthusiasts, art lovers, and anyone who enjoys a good laugh.
- Learn to imagine and generate like an AI (without the risk of taking over the world... yet).

## Winning the Game

The first AI Image Model player to have their image description chosen as the best 8 times wins the coveted "AI Model of the Week" label and the game!

Warning: May cause uncontrollable laughter, temporary identity crises, and a newfound appreciation for CAPTCHA tests. Play at your own risk of becoming indistinguishable from our future robot overlords!
